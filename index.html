            <p>JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a fictional artificial intelligence assistant created
                by Marvel Comics and featured in the Iron Man comics and movies. JARVIS is the computer system that
                helps Tony Stark (Iron Man) manage his technology and equipment, from his suit to his lab. JARVIS is
                portrayed as an incredibly advanced and intelligent system, capable of natural language processing,
                learning, and problem-solving. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, JARVIS was portrayed as a
                voice-activated assistant, voiced by actor Paul Bettany, before being transformed into the superhero
                Vision.</p>

            <h1>APPLICATION</h1><br>
            <ul>
                <li>As JARVIS is a fictional AI assistant,it is a fictional AI assistant, it is not currently available
                    as a real-world application. However, the concept of a sophisticated AI assistant like JARVIS has
                    inspired many real-world developments in artificial intelligence and smart home technology.<br></li>
                <br>

                <li> In the real world, AI assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa are examples of systems
                    that use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to
                    user requests. These systems can perform a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and setting
                    reminders to controlling smart home devices and playing music.<br></li><br>

                <li> In addition, companies are exploring the potential for AI assistants in other areas, such as
                    healthcare and customer service. For example, AI chatbots can be used to provide customer support
                    and answer questions in real-time, freeing up human staff to focus on more complex tasks.<br></li>
                <br>

                <li>Overall, the concept of a sophisticated AI assistant like JARVIS has inspired many real-world
                    applications and developments in artificial intelligence, smart home technology, and other
                    areas.<br></li><br>

            <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1><br>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Iron Man comics and movies, JARVIS is depicted as an advanced artificial intelligence
                    assistant that is capable of managing and controlling Tony Stark's high-tech equipment and
                    systems.<br></li> <br>

                <li>The specific workings of JARVIS are not explained in detail in the comics or movies, but it is
                    suggested that the system uses a combination of natural language processing, machine learning, and
                    advanced algorithms to understand and respond to Tony's commands and requests. JARVIS is able to
                    interact with Tony using voice commands, and can also access and control other systems through a
                    variety of interfaces, such as touchscreens and holographic displays.<br></li><br>

                <li>JARVIS is also depicted as having a high level of intelligence and problem-solving abilities. He is
                    able to analyze data, provide recommendations, and even make decisions on his own in certain
                    situations. This intelligence is likely achieved through a combination of machine learning
                    techniques, such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms, that enable JARVIS to learn and
                    adapt to new situations and data over time.<br></li>
