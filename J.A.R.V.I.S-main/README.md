# Convert .py to .exe

## Jarvis Application
The following will tell you how to conver the python code to an executable .exe file on your OS system.

### How to convert a `.py` to `.exe` file

1. Go to the Project directory.
2. Make sure you have `pyinstaller` is installed.
3. Run the following command in the terminal, (This will take time, be patience).

    ```
    pyinstaller --onefile JARVIS.py
    ```
4. A folder named `dist` will be created in the project directory, you can find the `JARVIS.exe` file in it.

This will make a completely runnable .exe file for jarvis.

## Introduction üë®‚Äçüíª
It is a voice assistant which can be used to interact with your computer and also you have been seeing it in Iron man movies, but this JARVIS is not that much advanced as shown in movies. 

### Built with: Python<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/python/python.png" alt="Python" height="40" style="vertical-align:top">

- Demo video for ***JARVIS*** is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14w4dQUpqVOmGvAXEn8vYkHQUmMYU72wIb-AK0SWCWYk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Cool functionalities of JARVIS üòé :)

I have wrote code which you can use JARVIS in the following ways :

- It can tell **count of Covid-19 cases for each state in India**
- It can do **Screen Recording with voice recording** stuff.
- It can also do **voice recording**
- It can access your **mobile camera**
- It can access your **web camera**

- <details>
  <summary>It can find the location of a phone number</summary>
  <br>
  
    Unfortunately there is no such thing as magic, and neither we, nor anyone else, have the ability to derive a phone‚Äôs location from an input string.
    
    <b>Here is what is actually happening:</b>

    The phone number is entered and a library is used to turn the country calling code into the name of the country. For example numbers starting with +91 becomes India, +880 is Bangladesh, +34 is Spain, etc.

    The country name is then sent to our geocoding API as a forward geocoding request (placename to coordinates). We then return the coordinates of the center of the country. For example we turn India into 22.3511148, 78.6677428, roughly in the middle of Uttar Pradesh.

    People get confused and angry as to why the coordinates are not actually where the phone is physically located.

    Reference: [We can NOT convert a phone number into a location. Sorry.](https://blog.opencagedata.com/post/we-can-not-convert-a-phone-number-into-a-location-sorry)

## API keys üîë
To run this project you should need some API key's for reading news, for finding phone number location. Register for your API key by clicking the following
- [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) : used for fetching news
- [Open cage](https://opencagedata.com/) : to locate a place in maps

> *Note* : supported OS : **Windows**, working on the making the JARVIS for Linux, but it many take some time.

## Installation üíª
- You need to first ```fork``` this repository and ```clone``` the repository to your local system 

    ```git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/J.A.R.V.I.S.git```
- Make sure to install all the required python modules mentioned above or you can simply install them by 

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

    > Note: For any errors while installing the python modules refer [**```ERRORS.md```**](https://github.com/BolisettySujith/J.A.R.V.I.S/blob/main/ERRORS/ERRORS.md) because I got some errors while installing and using them.
- Add the correct **system** paths in ```JARVIS.py``` to open the **system applications**
- Add your **gmail id** and **password** to send emails(line:797,798)
- Make sure you have registerd in [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and replace the ```apiKey=```**```YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY```** with your API key(Line: 852) and in [Open cage](https://opencagedata.com/) and replace the ```API_key =``` "**```_OPEN_CAGE_GEOCODE_API_KEY_```**" with your API key(PhoneNumber.py(lineNo: 13))
- For using mobile camera you need to first install an app in mobile called [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en_US&gl=US) after installing go to **START SERVER** it will open your mobile camara at the bottom of the screen you can see **IPv4** there you can find the IP address and replace ```_IP_Webcam_IP_address_``` with the IP address in ```JARVIS.py``` MobileCamera function(line: 332)
- Add the correct system paths to gifs or for background images in **```JarvisUi.py```** and **```JARVIS.py```**. If you got any elements missing(RED SCREEN) refer [**```ERRORS.md```**](https://github.com/BolisettySujith/J.A.R.V.I.S/blob/main/ERRORS/ERRORS.md) file.
- Finally run the  **```python JARVIS.py```** file

That's it **#Enjoy** speaking with your computer friend üòÅ

Demo video for ***JARVIS*** is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14w4dQUpqVOmGvAXEn8vYkHQUmMYU72wIb-AK0SWCWYk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Motivation for this projectüôÉ
Due to covid19 in my house I'm in a seperate room, without talking with anyone, so thought to talk with my laptop which I will use everyday, and came up with this project.

## How to Contribute ü§î

To contribute to this project please read the [CONTRITUTING.md](https://github.com/BolisettySujith/J.A.R.V.I.S/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Want to run JARVIS as an Application?
Read [this](https://github.com/BolisettySujith/J.A.R.V.I.S/blob/main/py2exe.md), to convert a .`py` file to `.exe` file. 

## Future plansüòá

In the present JARVIS GUI we cannot see the commands running but they are visible on the terminal, so plan to bring up the commands to display on the GUI.

If you like the repository **```FORK && clone```** üç¥ the repository, start using JARVIS, and don't forget to **‚≠ê** the repository.
